# Report: The Benefits of Comprehensive Testing in Software Development

Before doing all of the tests, the code technically worked, but it was difficult to know exactly what parts of the application were functioning correctly and which parts were not. Without automated tests, any changes made to the code felt risky because there was no reliable way to confirm that existing functionality had not been broken. Developers had to rely heavily on manual testing, which was time-consuming and inconsistent, making the codebase difficult to trust and maintain over time.
After adding unit tests, the code became much easier to understand. The tests clearly defined what each function in the code was supposed to do and what its responsibilities were. Instead of guessing how a function should behave, the tests acted as a form of documentation that explained the intended behavior of the system. This made it easier to reason about the code and identify the purpose of individual components. As a result, maintaining the code became more straightforward, since any problems or unexpected behavior could be reliably detected and fixed using the test results.
Testing provided several important benefits, including early bug detection and improved code clarity. Automated tests strengthened the development workflow by ensuring that all tests ran automatically and consistently whenever changes were made. This greatly reduced the need for repeated manual testing and lowered the chances of human error. When a test failed, it immediately highlighted the source of the problem, allowing issues to be addressed quickly and efficiently.
Overall, testing made the code easier to work with as a developer. It improved my understanding of the API by clearly showing how each endpoint and function was expected to behave. Having tests in place made it much simpler to build new features, since there was confidence that existing functionality would remain stable. The presence of automated tests increased my confidence in the codebase and reduced the fear that changes would cause the application to crash or behave unpredictably.
